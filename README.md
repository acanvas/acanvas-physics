# Acanvas Physics

*Acanvas Physics – for Dart 2.0 and StageXL.*

*Acanvas Physics* is part of a layered architecture [(diagram)](http://acanvas.sounddesignz.com/template/assets/home/acanvas_spring_architecture.png) originally conceived for [Actionscript](https://github.com/acanvas/acanvas-actionscript-framework),
and has been used in dozens of highly interactive rich media projects (marketing) for clients such as Mercedes-Benz, Nike, and Nikon, serving millions of users.

Build your own *Acanvas* project now – with *[Acanvas Generator](https://github.com/acanvas/acanvas-generator)*!
* Blazing fast IoC/DI/MVC UI framework for WebGL and Canvas2D, written in Dart.
* Write web apps, games, or both, in pure Dart. No HTML, no CSS, no JS.

## Features

*Acanvas Physics* is a port of Box2DFlash by Matt Bush and John Nessky, which is itself a port of Box2D by Erin Catto.

*Collision*
* Continuous collision detection.
* Contact callbacks: begin, end, pre-solve, post-solve.
* Convex polyons and circles.
* Multiple shapes per body.
* One-shot contact manifolds.
* Dynamic tree broadphase.
* Efficient pair management.
* Fast broadphase AABB queries.
* Collision groups and categories.

*Physics*
* Continuous physics with time of impact solver.
* Persistent body-joint-contact graph.
* Island solution and sleep management.
* Contact, friction, and restitution.
* Stable stacking with a linear-time solver.
* Revolute, prismatic, distance, pulley, gear, mouse joint, and other joint types.
* Joint limits, motors, and friction.
* Momentum decoupled position correction.
* Fairly accurate reaction forces/impulses.

## Examples

The *[Acanvas Physics Demo](http://acanvas.sounddesignz.com/acanvas-physics/)* is a direct port of the original Box2D library.
